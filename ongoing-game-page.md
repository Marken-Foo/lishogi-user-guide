# Playing a game

While playing a game, your screen will have the following information:

IMAGE

- Top left: Game information.
- Middle left: In-game chat.
- Bottom left: The list of spectators currently watching your game.
- Middle: The board. You can resize the board by dragging the bottom right corner.
- Bottom: Crosstable. Displays the results of the most recent games against your opponent, the lifetime score, and the score this session.
- Right: The piece pockets, move list, and game.


## In-game chat

You can chat with your opponent here. These messages will only be visible to you and your opponent. After the game, you can come back to view the chat by clicking the game link from your profile.

At the bottom are buttons for preset greetings: "GG" (Good game), "WP" (Well played), "TY" (Thank you), "GTG" (I've got to go), and "BYE" (Bye!). It is customary to offer some form of greeting at the start and end of the game.

Note that this chat is different from the spectator chat, which is where spectators can discuss your game while you're playing.

Tip: To send a message that the spectators can see but your opponent cannot see, put `/w ` before your message, e.g. `/w I think my position is bad.`


## Movelist and game actions

Using the buttons above the movelist, you can flip the board orientation and navigate forward and backwards through the game. If your opponent moves, make sure you return to the current position and continue playing!

Under the movelist are the game actions.

- The back arrow asks your opponent for a takeback. Your opponent has to accept it for the takeback to happen. This option will be unavailable if either you or your opponent has disabled takebacks in your account settings.
- The book icon lets you see the impasse (jishogi) status, and to end the game by impasse declaration if the conditions are met.
- The flag icon lets you resign. You can choose whether one click or two clicks are needed in your account settings.

At the very start of the game, the takeback button is replaced by the abort button. If either side has not moved yet, they may abort the game with no result and no change in rating. **Do note that excessively aborting games will lead to punishment by moderators.**

At the end of the game, the game actions are replaced with new buttons.

- "Rematch" sends a rematch request to your opponent. If they accept, you will be taken to the new game automatically. You can cancel your rematch request at any time by clicking the button again. You can decline a rematch by clicking the cross next to the rematch button.
- "New opponent" takes you to the main lobby, automatically creating a seek with the same parameters as the game you just finished.
- "Analysis board" takes you to the [analysis board](/game-analysis-page.md) where you can analyse the game by yourself or with an engine, and download or export your game.
