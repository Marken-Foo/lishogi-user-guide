# lishogi studies

lishogi studies are a powerful tool that you can use to store your kifu, share tsumeshogi problems and games with others, organise your joseki study, analyse games together with other people using a shared board, and much more.

You can take a look at some of the [most popular studies that other users have made](https://lishogi.org/study/all/popular) for an idea of the possibilities.

The study main page is available from "Learn > Study" on the navigation bar, or at [https://lishogi.org/study](https://lishogi.org/study)

## Create your first study

Click the green plus symbol on the lishogi studies page to make a new study.

You can click the `i` icon below the board for a quick tour of the Study function.

You now have a board you can make moves with. All the moves you make will be saved in the movelist on the right, including all variations. To delete a move or variation, right click on the move in the movelist and select "Delete from here".

You can have more than one chapter in a study. Each chapter is an independent kifu which you can play through or edit. A study can be a convenient way to gather similar kifu together, such as tsumeshogi problems, joseki lines, or games with the same player. To add a chapter, go to the Chapter tab in the top left.

You can also collaborate with multiple users on the same study. To add members, go to the Members tab in the top left. By default, they will be added as spectators who can see the study, but not edit it. To allow them to edit the study, click the gear icon on the right of their username, where you can make them contributors.

## Chapters

The button at the bottom of the chapter list lets you add a new chapter. You need to choose an **initial position** for the chapter.

- "Empty" starts from the default initial position.
- You can have a custom starting position using the Editor or SFEN options.
- You can also import games from a lishogi URL, or from a KIF or CSA file.

The initial position cannot be changed once the chapter is created. The other options can be changed later, however.

**Orientation** lets you choose whether the board is from sente's or gote's point of view. **Analysis mode** lets you select how the chapter will appear to non-contributors; you can use this to set puzzles where the next move is hidden, for example. (See [an example study with all the options](https://lishogi.org/study/hxEw60nj).) And of course, you can **name** your chapter.

Once done, create your chapter and it will appear in the chapter list.

### Editing/deleting a chapter

To edit a chapter, click on the gear icon on the right of the chapter in the chapter list. From the dialog, you can rename the chapter, change the orientation and analysis mode, clear all annotations and comments while leaving the moves, or delete the whole chapter.


## Organising moves

When you make moves in a chapter, they will be saved in the movelist.

To toggle how the moves appear, click the 3 lines at the bottom right of the movelist, and toggle the **Inline notation** option. You can also see some engine analysis options from this menu.

You can navigate through the moves made using the arrows below the movelist, with your arrow keys, or with your scroll wheel while your cursor is over the board. Clicking a move in the movelist will take you directly to that move.

When you make a different move on the board compared to the movelist, you will make a variation. You can have as many variations as you want on a move, and you can have variations within variations (but keep in mind the readability of your study).

When you right click a move, you can **promote the variation** to move it up in the list of variations for that move, or you can **make it the mainline** of the chapter. You can also **delete** it and all of the moves that come after it, if you have made a mistake.


## Annotating moves

You can add comments and annotations that others can read to any move in a study. Right click the move, or go to the move and go to the **comment tab** (speech bubble) or **annotation tab** (!?) below the board.

In the comment tab, you can type text that will appear to others in the movelist and in the comment tab. If your comment is too long, only the first part will display in the movelist, but others can still read the full comment in the comment tab.

In the annotation tab, you can assign symbols to the moves to convey meanings like "good move" or "sente is better". These symbols are commonly used in chess.

Tip: When typing in the comment box and your cursor is in the text, if you use the scroll wheel to go through moves, you will still be commenting on the move you were at! Click the comment tab icon again to refresh it.


## Other kifu settings

You can add specific information to the kifu of each chapter, including game information such as the players and the date it was played, or puzzle information such as the author and date of publication. To do so, go to the **Tags** tab (the icon looks like a tag). You can add new tags from the dropdown menu there. These tags are included in standard KIF and CSA game information.

From the Tags tab, you can also manage your study's Topics, which are tags for your study to make it more easily searchable on lishogi.


## Study settings and deletion

To change your study settings or delete your study, click the three lines next to the chapter list and member list. A dialog will pop up where you can rename the study, and change several other settings.

- **Visibility**: Public makes it visible to anyone. Unlisted hides it from people searching or looking at the list of your studies, but anyone with a direct link can still access it. Private allows only people you have invited as spectators or contributors from the Members list to see it.
- Copy (study cloning), computer analysis, opening explorer (not implemented yet), and chat permissions. If disabled, the viewers will not be able to use these features.
- Sync: Whether or not everyone looking at the study will be on the same position in a chapter. Sync is useful for postgame analysis or delivering lectures, but less useful for puzzle collections.
- Study pinned comment: A comment that will appear below the board, regardless of which chapter you're on.

If you're the study owner, you can also clear all messages in the chat, or delete the entire study from this dialog.


### Other study options

**REC**: For contributors. Click to toggle. If there is a green tick, the moves you make on the board will be saved; if there is a red cross, the moves will not be saved.

**SYNC**: Available if sync is turned on in the study options.

If you are the owner or a contributor, click to toggle sync. If it is green, viewers will be synced to whichever chapter and move you are currently on. If it is red, you can browse freely without other viewers following.

If you are a viewer, if the icon is green, you are following the current position. If you navigate away by yourself, the icon will turn red. Click SYNC again to resync and go back to the host's position.

Computer analysis: Request server analysis for the mainline of the current chapter. You can only request this once per chapter.


## Exporting your study

Each chapter of your study can be exported as a KIF or CSA file. Go to the Share & Export tab (3 connected circles) and you can download the current chapter as a KIF or CSA file with all your comments and annotations.

Note that **the CSA format does not support variations** and will not include your variations, so if your chapter has variations included, you may want to download it as a KIF file.

In the Share & Export tab, you can also get links to your study to share with other people, or export the mainline of your chapter as an animated GIF file. You can also clone your study, making a private, identical copy of it.
