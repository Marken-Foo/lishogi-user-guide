# Lishogi user guide

Welcome to lishogi! This guide will help you understand lishogi's features and get you started!

(Guide under construction; will improve further. English only for now.)


## What is lishogi?

lishogi is a free all-in-one shogi site where you can play games, analyse games with a computer, solve tsumeshogi and next-move problems, save your opening analysis, and much more.

lishogi is also mobile-friendly: you can use lishogi from your phone's browser.


## Quick start

lishogi has many, many features to explore, but if you just want to dive right in and start playing, here's the fastest way!

1. Register for a lishogi account and log in.
2. Customise the site appearance: Click your username in the top right (the gear if you're not logged in.)
3. Accept a seek from the lobby, or create your own seek!


## I want to play shogi!

From the lobby on the main page, you can see game seeks that other people have made. Clicking on a seek will accept it and take you straight into [a game](/ongoing-game-page.md) with that player. You can also create a seek with your preferred settings.

If you want to play against someone specifically, you can use the "Play with a friend" button to create a game invitation link. Your friend just needs to click the link and accept; they don't even need to have a lishogi account!

If you want to create a handicap game, use the "Play with a friend" button too. Lobby seeks can only be standard shogi games.

To play against different levels of AI (YaneuraOu), use the "Play with the computer" button. You will be able to download and analyse your game afterwards.

See the [guide to the lobby and creating games](/lobby-games.md).

Also consider joining an arena tournament, which lasts a fixed amount of time and automatically matches you against other participants. You can join or leave any time you want. Find out how arenas work in the [Arena tournament FAQ](https://lishogi.org/tournament/help?system=arena).

You can also create or join simultaneous exhibitions, where one player plays multiple games at once, possibly with a handicap or from special positions.


## I want to analyse my games with a computer!

For games played on lishogi, you can simply go to the game and use the in-browser engine to analyse - turn it on at the top-right corner of the movelist. You can [see any user's past games from their profile page](/user-profile.md).

For better quality analysis, you can request server-side engine analysis of games from the [game's page](/game-analysis-page.md).

You can also [import games](https://lishogi.org/paste) that were played elsewhere, and analyse them on lishogi!


## I want to analyse my games with another person! Share my study notes! Organise my joseki preparation!...

[Lishogi studies](https://lishogi.org/study) are an incredibly powerful tool that let you do all of that, and more. [Learn how to make and use lishogi studies](/lishogi-study.md)!


## I want to watch people playing shogi!

[lishogi TV](https://lishogi.org/tv) will show the currently ongoing top games in lishogi.

You can also follow the games of a specific user as they play by clicking the TV icon in their user profile.

If there are streamers registered with lishogi currently streaming, links to their streams will be featured on the lishogi homepage at the top left.


## I want to learn shogi!

You can learn the rules from the [Learn section](https://lishogi.org/learn). Once you know the basics, you can proceed to look at what other users have made with lishogi studies, or go through some useful resources we have linked to.


## How do I change lishogi's appearance?

You can change the language, board and piece appearance, move notation format, and even the background image from the menu after **clicking on your username at the top right**.

Tip: Setting the background to transparent allows you to choose your own background image to display.
