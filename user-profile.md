# User profile

From the user profile page, you can get statistics about a player's ratings and see their games, studies, and more.

You can see any user's profile by clicking on their username link. To see your own profile, you can also click your username at the top right and select "Profile".

## Under the username

Under the user's name are some clickable statistics.

- Followers: Clicking shows you a list of who follows them (and a link to see who they follow)
- Tournament points: How many points they have scored in total in [arena tournaments](https://lishogi.org/tournament/help?system=arena). Clicking takes you to a list of all tournaments they have participated in.
- Studies: The total number of [studies](/lishogi-study.md) they have created. Clicking takes you to a list of all the publicly-visible ones.
- Forum posts: Clicking takes you to a list of the forum posts the user has made.
- Notes: A place where you can leave notes about the user. These are not visible to the user themself.


## User actions

On the top right are buttons for several common actions.

- TV: Spectate the user as they play games. If they start a new live game, you will automatically follow them to the new game.
- Crossed swords: Challenge the user to a game.
- Speech bubble: Send a private message to the user.
- Thumbs up: Follow the user. When you follow a user, their activity will show up in your timeline on the main page. You will also be able to see if they're online or offline from the friends list in the bottom right of the page.
- Block: Block the user. When you block a user, they cannot follow you, challenge you to a game, accept your lobby seeks, or message you privately. However, you can still get matched with them in an arena tournament.
- Report: Report the user for behaviour that goes against the Terms of Service, such as cheating, harassment, or rating manipulation. You can write an explanation of why you are reporting them. The reports will be handled by moderators.

## Ratings

The player's ratings for the different categories will appear on the left side. Clicking a category will take you to a more detailed statistics page, where you can see their highest and lowest ratings, the highest rated players they defeated, the average opponent rating, and more.

## Ratings graph

The ratings graph shows the player's progression over time.

## Profile information

If the player has set up their profile information, you will see it here, along with some minor statistics and any lishogi teams they may have joined. Some of the less obvious statistics are:

- Game completion rate: The percentage of the last 30 losses where the game ended by the user disconnecting or letting time run out instead of resigning. This also includes games that the user aborted, and arena games where they didn't make the first move in time.
- Time on TV: The total time that the user's games were featured on [lishogi TV](https://lishogi.org/tv) in any of the categories.

On your own profile, you can also click "favourite opponents" to see the opponents you've played the most games with. You can also [fill in your profile](https://lishogi.org/account/profile), with a description and links to your social media profiles or sites. 


## Played games

**To see a user's games, click the Games tab next to the Activity tab.**

The user's games appear with the most recent at the top (scroll down to load more). You can apply default filters (e.g. wins only, losses only) by clicking the respective tabs. For more powerful search options, use the Advanced Search, which lets you filter in more detail (by date, player rating, etc).

**Clicking on a game displayed in the list takes you to the [game page](/game-analysis-page.md).**

(Note: If you click on a game from your own profile, you will go to a slightly different [game page](/ongoing-game-page.md) instead where you can see the private in-game chat between you and your opponent. From there, click "Analyse" to go to the regular game page.)


## User mini tooltip

In many locations around the site, if you hover on a username, you can see a tooltip appear with some information about them. You can see their ratings, the ongoing game they are playing (if any), and your lifetime score against them. From the tooltip you can find shortcuts to watch their games, message them, challenge them to a game, or follow them.

Tip: Clicking the lifetime score will take you to the "Games with you" tab of their profile page where you can see all those games.
