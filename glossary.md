What is...?

## Byoyomi

Byoyomi is a type of time control commonly used in shogi and go. Byoyomi starts when a player uses up all of their main thinking time. From this point on, the player must make each move within this amount of time. For example, in a 15|60 game, once a player uses all their 15 minutes of main time, all of their subsequent moves must be made within 60 seconds each.

For those familiar with Bronstein delay from chess, the byoyomi phase is equivalent to having a Bronstein delay with no main time. For example, a 15|60 game effectively has a first phase of a flat 15 minutes, followed by a second phase of 0 main time and a delay of 60 seconds.


## Fischer increment

Fischer increment is a type of time control used in chess, and more recently being adopted for shogi as well. For every move a player makes, they get a small amount added to their remaining thinking time. A player still loses if their remaining time hits zero.


## Premoves

Premoves are a feature of online chess that is also offered on lishogi.

While it's your opponent's turn, you can make a premove on the board for the move you want to play next. After your opponent moves, if your premove is legal, it will be played immediately without using your thinking time. If not, the premove will have no effect.

Premoves are useful for very fast games, but beware that they will be played as long as they are legal, even if your opponent didn't play what you expected! Safe premoves can save you some time though, for example recapturing moves (since they are only legal if your opponent takes your piece in the first place).


## Zen mode

Zen mode is an option that gives you minimal information while playing games. It removes the left sidebar (in-game chat, spectator list, opponent name and ratings), the right side bar (the move list and the opponent's rating) and the crosstable below the board.

Zen mode can be useful if you want to focus on the game with fewer distractions, or if you don't want to be influenced by your opponent's rating.
